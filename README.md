# Patanjali Yogini
PWP www.patanjaliyogini.com


**For Milestone-1:**

Purpose: What would you like your PWP to help you accomplish? This is a high-level goal akin to a Mission Statement.

Audience: Who will be using or viewing your site? Who is this site designed for, and who is your audience comprised of? Could it be for your professional peers and other developers, potential employers, customers, or clients, etc.?

Goal: This should be a quantifiable goal if possible. For example, a goal for your PWP could be:
- To acquire full or part-time employment or an internship.
- To increase sales and/or conversion rates for an existing business.
- To attract freelance clients.
- To serve as a gallery to showcase and promote your work.
- To increase the reach of a new or established social media presence (as measured via analytics tools).

**Milestone 2 Requirements**

Create a new document inside the /documentation directory titled milestone-2.html. Simply document the requirements below in simple, valid HTML. No CSS or styling is necessary or required.
Content Strategy

Document - in detail - the content you plan to feature in each section of your site. Be sure to include any details regarding interactive features and functionality that you wish to include. You are not expected to have any actual content prepared at this time, rather only a plan for the kind of content you would like to feature.

Keep this section brief and succinct, yet detailed enough to guide your development phase. One paragraph per content section should be sufficient. Use the Sample PWP Milestones as a guide.
Wireframes

One mobile and one desktop wireframe will be required for your project.

Your wireframes may be created using the tool of your choice, but they must be in an electronic format.

Tool choices for your wireframes may include, but are not limited to, the following:

    Online wireframing tools such as MockFlow (recommended), balsamiq, wireframe.cc, etc.
    Photoshop/Illustrator/GIMP/MacPaint/Inkscape, etc.

Place your wireframe images in your milestone-2.html document. Image files must be less than 2MB in size, and in SVG, JPEG, PNG, or GIF format.

After instructor sign-off on Milestone 2, you are clear to begin development on your PWP.
