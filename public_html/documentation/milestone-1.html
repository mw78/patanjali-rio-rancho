!---Purpose, Audience, and Goal of the website--->
<body>

    <div class="body">

        <h1>Purpose:</h1>

        <p>The website will be a small business website with focus on the front-end. It will also include a form for people<br>
            to sign up and receive a <em>daily mantra</em>. In the future it might have a section for some e-commerce<br>
            (registration for online Yoga classes). But momentarily this is out of scope.</p>

        <h1>Audience:</h1>

        <p> The website is targeted towards private individuals not only interested in taking Yoga classes but with a special interest<br>
            in classical Yoga including Kriya rituals and Pranayama techniques for both physical and mental well-being. The philosophy and practices<br>
            are based on the ancient scriptures of Maharshi Patanali's Yoga Sutras.</p>

        <h1>Goal:</h1>
        <p> The primary goal is to attract individuals with a special interest in classical Yoga and Patanjali so they inquire about classes.<br>
        The secondary goal is to use this website for my professional portfolio.</p>
